# Baseball-Shooter-Gradle
The baseball shooter code in a new, exciting format!

## Cloning and editing the project

This project uses GradleRIO, the Gradle-based FRC toolchain. You can read more about GradleRIO [here](https://github.com/Open-RIO/GradleRIO).

To clone the project, first clone it into your working directory with ```git clone``` or the GitHub Desktop app.

Then generate the project files for your IDE:
- ```gradlew idea``` (IntelliJ IDEA)
- ```gradlew eclipse``` (Eclipse)

IntelliJ IDEA has native support for Gradle. Eclipse users should install the [http://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship](Buuildship Gradle plugin for Eclipse), as the plugin does NOT come with the C++ distribution!

Eclipse users should also DISABLE WPILib if they have it installed. 

## Building and deploying your code
- ```gradlew build``` will build your Robot Code
- ```gradlew deploy``` will build and deploy your code to the RoboRIO

More instructions on how to use GradleRIO are located in GradleRIO4Dummies.txt.

## Pushing to GitHub

To push your updates to GitHub, simply use ```git push``` the Github Desktop app.

*Make sure that the project files generated by your IDE are not being tracked by Git!*
